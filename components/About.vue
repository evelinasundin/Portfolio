  <p> I'm Evelina, a 26 year old frontend developer from Stockholm. I started my journey as a developer at Nackademin polytechnic school in 2016. In my second year I had an internship at Oh My which later became my workplace and is where I've been working since then.
    I love making dynamic and responsive websites and have a huge interest in clean aesthetics, typography and simplistic UX/UI solutions.
